Log-based anomaly detection is a essential task for
ensuring the reliability and performance of software systems. However, the performance of existing anomaly detection methods heavily relies on labeling, while labeling a large volume of logs is highly challenging. To address this issue, many approaches based on transfer learning and active learning have been proposed. Nevertheless, their effectiveness is hindered by issues such as the gap between source and target system data distributions and cold-start problems. In this paper, we propose LogAction, a novel log-based anomaly detection model based on active domain adaptation. LogAction integrates transfer learning and active learning techniques. On one hand, it uses labeled data from a mature system to train a base model, mitigating the cold-start issue in active learning. On the other hand, LogAction utilize free energy-based sampling and uncertainty-based sampling to select logs located at the distribution boundaries for manual labeling, thus addresses the data distribution gap in transfer learning with minimal human labeling efforts. Experimental results on six different combinations of datasets demonstrate that LogAction achieves an average 93.01% F1 score with only 2% of manual labels, outperforming some state-of-the-art methods by 26.28%.

## Key Contributions
1. We propose LogAction, a novel generalizable anomaly detection approach via active domain adaptation.

2.  We utilize global embedding and contrastive learning techniques to mitigate the data distribution gap, while employing active learning to reduce human labeling efforts, effectively addressing the two primary challenges in Cross-system Anomaly Detection task.

3.  Evaluation results on three open datasets show the significant effectiveness of our approach.

    <p><em>Figure 2: The overview of LogAction. LogAction includes three main phases: Log Parser, Encoding and Active Domain Adaptation. Firstly, the raw system logs are labeled and parsed into log event sequences. Secondly, LogAction encodes the log sequences from both the source system and the target system, mapping them to similar distribution. Finally, LogAction is initially trained using labeled log vectors from the source system. Subsequently, it is fine-tuned with a very limited amount of target system logs via active learning to adapt to cross-system anomaly detection.</em></p>

    <p><em>Figure 3: The Encoding Phase. In the initial stage, log sequences from the source system and the target system originate from distinct distributions (located in different hyperplanes). Employing contrastive learning, the objective is to map the distributions of normal log sequences from the source system and normal as well as anomalous log sequences from the target system to similar distributions (situated within the same hyperplane).</em></p>

<!-- ## Table: Comparison of Computable and Non-Computable Numbers

| Computable Numbers | Non-Computable Numbers |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Rational numbers, e.g., 1/2, 3/4 | Transcendental numbers, e.g., π, e |
| Algebraic numbers, e.g., √2, ∛3 | Non-algebraic numbers, e.g., √2 + √3 |
| Numbers with finite decimal representations | Numbers with infinite, non-repeating decimal representations |

He used the concept of a universal Turing machine to prove that the set of computable functions is recursively enumerable, meaning it can be listed by an algorithm. -->

## Significance
Turing's paper laid the foundation for the theory of computation and had a profound impact on the development of computer science. The Turing machine became a fundamental concept in theoretical computer science, serving as a theoretical model for studying the limits and capabilities of computation. Turing's work also influenced the development of programming languages, algorithms, and the design of modern computers. -->
